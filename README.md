# ABOUT
This website is a tool designed to help EVE Online players locate and track the status of Incursions within the game's universe. 

# WHAT ARE INCURSIONS?
Incursions in EVE Online are encounters in which fleets of pilots work to drive back NPC pirate invasions in across the game's universe. They represent high-end PVE content and are equivalent to 'raids' in other MMOs.

# HOW DOES IT WORK?
The site is statically generated by the `src/main.py` file.

`src/main.py` will asynchronously poll the EVE Online Incursions endpoint and generate an `index.html` file that can be served up by Github Pages.

# WHAT TECH IS BEING USED
- Python 3.7.3 (asyncio, aiohttp)
- Jinja2 for templating
- Github/Github Pages
